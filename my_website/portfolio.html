    <p>The purpose of these games is to demonstrate the utility of scratch. To make my second game, I've created a sprite that would have accurate hit detection and another sprite that would follow the hit detection and acts as the actual character that the player can control. I've encontered some bugs and was able to fix them by fixing some values in the script. The game took 8 hours to make.  </p>
    <h2>Python Interactive Fiction</h2>
    <a target="interactivefiction" href="https://repl.it/FBKK/13"><img src="images/pythonlogo.jpg" height="100"></a>
    <p>The making process of this story started out with the plot development of the story and finished by making the story interactive.The interactive element of the story simply consist of 
    "if,elif,else" input and return of the result based on the choices that the player make. The process of making the story feels like a matching problems in which how there are multiple different routes or choices that the player would make and the return results mmust match with the player's choices. </p>
